# 200 - Before you start

Before running the commands in the **Installation** section, note that Everest will search for the **kubeconfig** file in the ```~/.kube/config``` path. If your file is located elsewhere, use the export command below to set the ```KUBECONFIG``` environment variable:

```
$ export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config
```
