# 100 - Introduction

**Percona Monitoring Management** also known as PMM is an open source database monitoring observability and management tool. We can monitor the health our database infrastructure with customizable dashboards and real-time alerts using Grafana and Victoria metrics. In this tutorial we will cover two steps. 

- First set up a PM server that collects data and displays it
- Then sends data from our database to the pmm server.

For this example we will work with mySQL but you can do the same with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or AWS LDS.
